## üîß Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 1. Loading EEG Data
- **Script**: `scripts/load_data.m`
- Load raw EEG files using custom format readers.
- **Script**: `scripts/spike_times.m`
- Load spike times files which was marked by three epileptologists using custom format readers.

### 2. Creating Epochs
- **Script**: `scripts/create_epochs.m`
- Epoch EEG data around relevant event markers.

### 3. Labeling Epochs
- **Script**: `scripts/labeling.m`
- Assign labels to each trial based on conditions or event types.

### 4. Preprocessing
- **Script**: `scripts/preprocessing_function.m`
- Perform filtering.
- **Script**: `scripts/preprocessing.m`

### 5. Grand Averaging
- **Script**: `scripts/grand_averaging.m`
- Compute average ERPs or evoked responses across subjects/conditions.

### 6. MRI Preprocessing
- **Script**: `scripts/mri_preprocessing.m`
- Prepare structural MRI data for source localization.

### 7. Selecting Nodes
- **Script**: `scripts/select_nodes.m`
- Choose specific brain regions or sources for projection and analysis.

### 8. Source Waveform Projection
- **Script**: `scripts/source_projection.m`
- Use inverse modeling to project EEG data into source space.

### 9. ANN Function
- **Script**: `functions/create_ann.m`
- Define ANN architecture using MATLAB‚Äôs Deep Learning Toolbox.

### 10. ANN Training
- **Script**: `scripts/train_ann.m`
- Train ANN on extracted features and save the trained model.

### 11. Feature Extraction
- **Script**: `scripts/feature_extraction.m`
- Extract features such as mean amplitude, band power, or latency for classification.
